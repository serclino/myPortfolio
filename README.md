 ![Preview image](./resources/images/projects/myPortfolio-full.png)
 
 ##Features
 * opening animation when you visit my website
 * animated navbar when you hover over it
 * pop-up images within the Projects section
 * HTML form which takes advance of third party API, but thanks of AJAX there isn't redirect to the third's party webpage
 * night / day theme switcher; your browser will remember last setting you've made
 * very cool mandatory scrolling
 * responsivness for desktop and mobile (portrait only) works nice, for tablet it isn't 100% optimized
 
 ## Sources
 I got inspiration from another Personal Portfolio Projects at Codecademy + great lecture was watching YT videos from Dev Ed.
